This project aimed to identfy the best time to run for Brighton athletes with a plot. 
The data was scraped from the website https://www.thepowerof10.info/
Date was plotted on the x axis, with the average monthly 100m performances on the y axis. 
A userface was created. 
Furthermore, functions were made to scrape for athletes with relevant variables, calculate the lowest months average value, and then revert back to the original plot after the calculations. 
The user can also select specific athletes and view the best month for that athlete.
